    <h1>Non-Refundable and Cancellation Policy</h1>

    <p>Contributions made through Razorpay for PHi and Dva are non-refundable. Once a contribution is processed, it cannot be canceled, and no refunds will be provided. The perks associated with each contribution tier are outlined in the pricing policy, and backers should carefully review these before making a contribution.</p>

    <p>In the event that a funding goal is not met for a specific tier, contributors will be notified, and alternative arrangements or perks may be offered. Any concerns or inquiries about contributions can be directed to our support team at <a href="mailto:info@kyrelgames.in">info@kyrelgames.in</a>.</p>

    <p>Your support is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to bringing PHi and Dva to life with your generous contributions.</p>
