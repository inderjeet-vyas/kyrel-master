            Cancellation Policy: <br>
● Pre-orders can be canceled before the official game release date for a full
refund.<br>
● Once a game is released, cancellation is not possible, but the refund policy
still applies.<br>
● Kyrel reserves the right to cancel orders in the event of unforeseen
circumstances or if a game cannot be delivered as planned; refunds will be
issued in such cases.<br>
Please note that these policies are subject to change, and users are encouraged to
review them periodically for any updates.<br></span></h3>
